AWS related experiences, projects and learnings

In this section I will include AWS related code, learnings and experiences that I have.

About myself

I am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer for a shared services provider in the Philippines. We use AWS extensively in our environment. The files in this repo list some of the things I have learned while using AWS on a daily basis.
I am also AWS certified. I started my AWS certification journey last 2016 by completing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam. I the proceded to take the Systems Administrator - Associate, then finally, the Developer - Associate exam by 2017. By 2018 I have completed both AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional and AWS Certified DevOps - Professional exams by 2018.

I will divide this repo into several sections to help keep things organized:
-Python - Python scripts or code blocks that I have made or modified that help me in my day to day tasks.
-Terraform - Terraform config files that I have learned, created or modified that I use or find interesting.
-Certification - Learning notes or resources that I have use on studying for the certification exams.
