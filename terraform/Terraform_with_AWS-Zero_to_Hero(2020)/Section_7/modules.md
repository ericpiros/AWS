# Terraform Modules

Now modules is quite a big topic. It is important to note that the course only looks at local modules. Local modules are ones that you create locally. Terraform has an online module registry that can be used in place of local modules. You can find the AWS module registry [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest).
